Hey I'm Luca!

I'm a game designer / developer with interests in shaders, procedural animation, physics programming, and systems.

I also have a background in the arts, and I love combining these
previous experiences with my game development practices, whether
that be in the realms of animation, illustration, sound design,
or audio engineering!
