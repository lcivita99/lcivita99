Hey, I'm Luca!<br><br>

I'm a game designer / developer with interests in shaders, procedural animation, physics programming, and systems.<br><br>

I also have a background in the arts, and I love combining these previous experiences with my game development practices, whether that be in the realms of animation, illustration, sound design, or audio engineering!<br><br>
